##CookBook  
	1.Clean up workspace 
	2.Read data files
		# Read features,activityType, subjectTrain, xTrain, yTrain  data from files 
	3.Create final data sets.
		# Create the final training set by merging yTrain, subjectTrain, and xTrain 
		# trainingData = cbind(yTrain,subjectTrain,xTrain);	
		# Create the final test set by merging the xTest, yTest and subjectTest data
		# testData = cbind(yTest,subjectTest,xTest)
	4.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		# finalData = rbind(trainingData,testData);
	5.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
		# Assign column names to the test data imported above 
		# Extract columns which has the measurements on the mean and standard deviation using grepl
		# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set on column names
		# Merge the finalData set with the acitivityType table to in clude descriptive activity names 
		# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
		# Assign the new column names to the finalData
	14.From the final dataset creates a second, Find Mean of the data frame  finalData (use library dplyr) with summarise and group_by functions
	15.Export the tidyData set  
	write.table(finalMeanData, 'UCI HAR Dataset/finalMeanData.txt',row.names=FALSE,sep='\t');
